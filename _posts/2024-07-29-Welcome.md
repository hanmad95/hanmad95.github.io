# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for visiting my coding portfolio. This site is currently under construction, but I'm excited to share my projects and coding journey with you soon.  In the meantime, feel free to browse my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/hanmad95) to see some of my work in progress.

## What to expect

Once complete, this portfolio will showcase:

- **Personal Projects**: A collection of my personal coding projects, ranging from small scripts to full-fledged applications.
- **Technical Blog**: Articles and tutorials where I share what Iâ€™ve learned about programming, development tools, and best practices.
- **Resume**: An overview of my professional background, skills, and experience.
